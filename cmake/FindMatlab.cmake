# --------
# MATLABÂ® is a programming platform designed specifically for engineers
# and scientists. The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, a matrix-based
# language allowing the most natural expression of computational mathematics.
#
# This will define the following variables::
#
# MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIRS - the MATLAB include directories
# MATLAB_LIBRARIES - the Matlab libraries
# MATLAB_FOUND - A boolean that checks if matlab is found
